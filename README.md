- Autonomous vehicles are being used more and more these days in manufacturing industries, transport industry, consumer industry and many more.
- With these localization and accurate estimation of the positioning of the autonomous vehicle becomes very crucial.
- Common localization techniques include visual odometry and also localization using triangulation. But with the need of the industry more and more accuracy is required in the positioning of the autonomous vehicle.
- This repo contains the implementation of the journal paper named "Implementation of a Kalman Filter in Positioning for Autonomous Vehicles, and its Sensitivity to the Process Parameters" and proposed position estimation technique.
- It is based on accurate position estimation of the autonomous vehicle. The selected journal paper implements the technique of Kalman filter based estimation for accurate position estimation.
- And the said technique is implemented on an Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) in a manufacturing industry environment.
- Finally, the proposed technique in the journal paper has been implemented and its results are discussed.
